# 🖥️ Multiprogramming Operating System Simulator

Welcome to the **Multiprogramming OS Simulator**!  
This project is a hands-on technological journey into fundamental concepts of operating systems, featuring interactive CPU, memory, and process management simulations.  
Dive into the world of multiprogramming and discover how real operating systems manage resources, schedule processes, and handle interrupts—all in a safe, educational environment.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The simulator is built on a modular architecture, mimicking the core components of a real OS:
- **CPU Module**: Emulates instruction execution and context switching.
- **Memory Module**: Simulates RAM, paging, and address translation.
- **Process Manager**: Maintains PCB data, manages process states and scheduling.
- **Interrupt Handler**: Coordinates supervisor calls, errors, and asynchronous events.

## 🚀 Tech Highlights

### **Phase 1:**  
- **CPU & Machine Simulation** ⚙️  
  - Simulates instruction cycles, registers, and basic I/O.  
  - Provides hooks for supervisor calls and privilege checks.
- **Supervisor Calls via Interrupts** 🚨  
  - Implements SVCs for process management, memory allocation, and I/O.

### **Phase 2:**  
- **Paging Implementation** 🗂️  
  - Virtual memory management using page tables.
  - Supports page faults and dynamic allocation.
- **Robust Error Handling** ❌  
  - Detects illegal memory access, invalid instructions, and resource exhaustion.
- **Interrupt Generation & Servicing** 🔄  
  - Hardware and software interrupts, nested interrupt support, priority handling.
- **Process Control Block (PCB) Structure** 📊  
  - Tracks process ID, state, registers, memory maps, and scheduling information.

### **Planned Extensions:**  
- **Multi-level Scheduling**  
- **Device Driver Simulation**  
- **File System Layer (future release)**  
- **User/Kernel Mode Switching**
